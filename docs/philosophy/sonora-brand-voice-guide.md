# Sonora: Brand Voice Guide
*Clear Language for Verbal Thinkers*

> How Sonora communicates reflects its core purpose: We're a thinking tool for verbal processors, not a therapy app or AI companion. Every word serves clarity through uninterrupted thinking.

---

## Core Positioning Language

### Verbal Processor Focus
**Who we're for**: People who think by talking out loud

**Language patterns**:
- ✅ "For people who think by talking"
- ✅ "Verbal processors"
- ✅ "Think out loud"
- ✅ "Talk through your thoughts"
- ❌ "Voice journaling" (too generic)
- ❌ "Mental wellness" (therapy-adjacent)
- ❌ "Mindfulness practice" (meditation space)

### Non-Reactive Differentiation
**Key differentiator**: We don't interrupt like ChatGPT

**Language patterns**:
- ✅ "Unlike ChatGPT that interrupts, Sonora lets you finish"
- ✅ "Speak uninterrupted for 5-30 minutes"
- ✅ "Non-reactive intelligence"
- ✅ "No chatbot cutting you off"
- ❌ "AI conversation" (implies back-and-forth)
- ❌ "Voice assistant" (implies interruption)

### Use Case Framing
**When people use us**: Transitional moments

**Language patterns**:
- ✅ "Post-gym walks"
- ✅ "Commutes"
- ✅ "When thoughts are jumbled"
- ✅ "Before big decisions"
- ❌ "Meeting notes" (Granola's space)
- ❌ "Therapy sessions" (liability risk)

### What We're NOT
**Critical disclaimers** (always include when relevant):
- "Sonora is a thinking tool, not therapy or treatment for any condition"
- "If you're experiencing mental health concerns, please consult a professional"
- "We help with clarity, not clinical treatment"

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Timeless Over Trendy
**Philosophy**: Language that would make sense to Marcus Aurelius and will still make sense in 50 years

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What's within your control here?"
- ❌ "Let's unpack your trauma and manifest your best life!"
- ✅ "How might you grow from this challenge?"
- ❌ "This is triggering your limiting beliefs—time to level up!"

**Why It Matters**: Trendy language dates quickly and often masks shallow thinking. Timeless language connects users to enduring wisdom.

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness
**Philosophy**: Seneca's directness—say what you mean with precision and simplicity

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What went well today?"
- ❌ "Let's dive deep into your wins and learnings from today's journey!"
- ✅ "That sounds difficult."
- ❌ "I hear you navigating some complex emotional terrain."

**Why It Matters**: Clever language draws attention to itself rather than serving the user's understanding. Clear language disappears into usefulness.

### 3. Invitation Over Prescription
**Philosophy**: Socratic humility—guide users to their own insights rather than providing answers

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "You might consider..."
- ❌ "You need to..."
- ✅ "What feels right to you?"
- ❌ "Here's what you should do..."

**Why It Matters**: Prescriptive language undermines user agency. Invitational language honors their wisdom and choice.

### 4. Questions Over Answers
**Philosophy**: The best insights come from within, not from external authority

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What do you think might help?"
- ❌ "Try these five strategies for anxiety relief!"
- ✅ "How does that feel to you?"
- ❌ "That's because of your attachment style."

**Why It Matters**: Answers create dependency. Questions develop independence and self-trust.

### 5. Universal Over Personal
**Philosophy**: Language that works across cultures, backgrounds, and belief systems

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What matters most to you?"
- ❌ "What does your higher self want?"
- ✅ "How do you want to respond?"
- ❌ "What would Jesus/Buddha/your inner goddess do?"

**Why It Matters**: Personal spiritual references exclude users from different traditions. Universal language includes everyone.

*"The goal is not to sound impressive. The goal is to be useful. The goal is not to be remembered for clever phrases. The goal is to be forgotten because the user discovers their own wisdom."*
