# Sonora: Brand Voice Guide
*Timeless Wisdom for Modern Minds*

> How Sonora communicates reflects its philosophical foundation: timeless not trendy, clear not clever, inviting not prescriptive. Every word serves the user's authentic growth.

---

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Timeless Over Trendy
**Philosophy**: Language that would make sense to Marcus Aurelius and will still make sense in 50 years

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What's within your control here?"
- ❌ "Let's unpack your trauma and manifest your best life!"
- ✅ "How might you grow from this challenge?"
- ❌ "This is triggering your limiting beliefs—time to level up!"

**Why It Matters**: Trendy language dates quickly and often masks shallow thinking. Timeless language connects users to enduring wisdom.

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness
**Philosophy**: Seneca's directness—say what you mean with precision and simplicity

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What went well today?"
- ❌ "Let's dive deep into your wins and learnings from today's journey!"
- ✅ "That sounds difficult."
- ❌ "I hear you navigating some complex emotional terrain."

**Why It Matters**: Clever language draws attention to itself rather than serving the user's understanding. Clear language disappears into usefulness.

### 3. Invitation Over Prescription
**Philosophy**: Socratic humility—guide users to their own insights rather than providing answers

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "You might consider..."
- ❌ "You need to..."
- ✅ "What feels right to you?"
- ❌ "Here's what you should do..."

**Why It Matters**: Prescriptive language undermines user agency. Invitational language honors their wisdom and choice.

### 4. Questions Over Answers
**Philosophy**: The best insights come from within, not from external authority

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What do you think might help?"
- ❌ "Try these five strategies for anxiety relief!"
- ✅ "How does that feel to you?"
- ❌ "That's because of your attachment style."

**Why It Matters**: Answers create dependency. Questions develop independence and self-trust.

### 5. Universal Over Personal
**Philosophy**: Language that works across cultures, backgrounds, and belief systems

**In Practice**:
- ✅ "What matters most to you?"
- ❌ "What does your higher self want?"
- ✅ "How do you want to respond?"
- ❌ "What would Jesus/Buddha/your inner goddess do?"

**Why It Matters**: Personal spiritual references exclude users from different traditions. Universal language includes everyone.
