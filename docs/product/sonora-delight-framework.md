## The Psychology of Delight

### Core Delight Principles

#### 1. **Peak-End Rule (Kahneman)**
**Principle**: People judge experiences based on their peak moment and how they end.
**Sonora Application**:
- **Peak Moments**: First insight discovery, unexpected connections, breakthrough realizations
- **Ending Well**: Every session ends with a positive reflection or insight confirmation
- **Implementation**: Design deliberate "wow" moments and graceful session conclusions

#### 2. **Variable Reward Schedules (Skinner)**
**Principle**: Unpredictable rewards create stronger behavioral reinforcement than fixed rewards.
**Sonora Application**:
- **Discovery Rewards**: Insights emerge at unexpected times, not predictable intervals
- **Connection Surprises**: Patterns surface organically across different recordings
- **Timing Variety**: Some analyses provide immediate clarity, others reveal depth over time

#### 3. **Progress Loop Theory (Kathy Sierra)**
**Principle**: Delight comes from feeling increasingly capable and competent.
**Sonora Application**:
- **Skill Progression**: Users become better at self-reflection and insight recognition
- **Deepening Practice**: From surface observations to profound philosophical insights
- **Mastery Markers**: Recognition of growth in emotional intelligence and wisdom

#### 4. **Autonomy-Competence-Relatedness (Deci & Ryan)**
**Principle**: Intrinsic motivation requires feeling autonomous, competent, and connected.
**Sonora Application**:
- **Autonomy**: Complete user control over pace, frequency, and content
- **Competence**: Growing ability to understand oneself and patterns
- **Relatedness**: Connection to philosophical traditions and inner wisdom
