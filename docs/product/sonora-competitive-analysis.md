### Market Gaps Sonora Fills:

**1. The Wisdom Gap**
Most apps focus on techniques without philosophical foundation. Sonora provides practices grounded in humanity's most enduring insights.

**2. The Agency Gap**
Many apps create dependency (therapy, AI companions) or passivity (meditation, journaling). Sonora builds independent capability.

**3. The Integration Gap**
Apps typically address single aspects (mood, thoughts, meditation). Sonora integrates cognitive, emotional, and philosophical development.

**4. The Depth Gap**
Most apps provide surface-level solutions. Sonora develops fundamental changes in how users relate to their own minds.
