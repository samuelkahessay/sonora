## Implementation Principles

### 1. Progressive Complexity
Start with simple features that provide immediate value, then layer on sophisticated capabilities as users develop their practice.

### 2. Philosophical Integrity
Every feature must serve authentic mental training, not just engagement metrics or viral sharing.

### 3. User Sovereignty
Users maintain complete control over their data, insights, and practice. The app serves the user's growth, not the company's data collection.

### 4. Scientific Validation
New features are tested for actual effectiveness in mental training, not just user satisfaction or retention.

### 5. Sustainable Practice
Features support long-term mental development rather than quick fixes or emotional manipulation.
