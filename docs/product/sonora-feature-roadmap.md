# Sonora: Feature Roadmap
*Clarity Through Uninterrupted Thinking*

> This roadmap prioritizes features that serve verbal processors—people who think by talking out loud. Distill is the hero. Everything else is secondary.

---

## Tier 1: THE HERO FEATURE

### 1. Distill Mode - Uninterrupted Thinking → Instant Clarity
**Purpose**: Show verbal processors what they actually meant after speaking uninterrupted

**Why This is THE Feature**:
- This is why people use Sonora
- Replaces manual workflow: Record → Whisper → ChatGPT
- Non-reactive (unlike ChatGPT that interrupts)
- Core value prop: "Think out loud → Get clarity"

**Features** (Current):
- **Summary**: "Here's what you actually said" in 1-2 paragraphs
- **Key Themes**: Recurring patterns in this recording (Pro)
- **Action Items**: Concrete next steps you mentioned (Pro)
- **Reflection Questions**: Prompts to deepen thinking about patterns observed

**User Experience** (Current):
- Zero friction: Tap → Talk 5-30 minutes uninterrupted → Distill appears
- Works during post-gym walks, commutes, any transitional moment
- Automatic transcription + distillation
- No chatbot interrupting your flow

**Future Enhancements** (v2+):
- **Pattern tracking over time**: "You've mentioned 'work stress' in 5 recordings this month"
- **Faster Distill**: Reduce latency from transcription → analysis
- **Richer themes**: More sophisticated pattern recognition
- **Shareable insights**: Export Distill results

**Success Metric**: % of recordings that get Distill analysis, user satisfaction with clarity gained

## Tier 2: Core Supporting Features (Already Built)

### 2. Recording Prompts - Help Knowing What to Think About
**Purpose**: Many verbal processors struggle with "what should I talk about?"

**Features** (Current):
- 48 curated prompts with smart interpolation ([Name], [DayPart], [WeekPart])
- 7-day no-repeat algorithm
- "What's on your mind?" default prompt
- Inspire Me sheet for browsing prompts

**Why It Matters**: Removes barrier to starting—just pick a prompt and talk

**Future**: User-created custom prompts, mood-aware prompt suggestions

---

### 3. Frictionless Recording - Zero Barriers to Thinking
**Purpose**: Quick access to start thinking out loud

**Features** (Current):
- Live Activities in Dynamic Island
- Lock screen controls
- Background recording (walks, commutes)
- One-tap start
- Auto titles for organization

**Why It Matters**: Verbal processors need instant access when thoughts are jumbled

**Future**: Siri shortcut ("Hey Siri, think out loud"), Apple Watch controls

---

## Tier 3: Optional Depth Features (Lower Priority)

### 4. Historical View - See Thinking Evolution Over Time
**Purpose**: Understand how your thinking has changed

**Features** (Future):
- Timeline of all recordings
- Theme evolution over months
- Pattern recognition across sessions
- "You used to talk about X, now you talk about Y"

**Why Lower Priority**: Nice-to-have, not core to immediate clarity need

---

### 5. Socratic Reflection (Potential Future)
**Purpose**: Deepen thinking through reflection questions

**Features** (Concept):
- Post-recording: AI asks 2-3 follow-up questions
- Record brief responses
- Creates deeper Distill analysis

**Why Lower Priority**: Adds complexity, many users just want clarity from one session

**Note**: This is NOT conversational AI (not reactive) - it's post-recording reflection prompts

---

## Features We're NOT Building

### ❌ Therapy Features
- No clinical CBT exercises
- No mood tracking for mental health
- No therapeutic interventions
- **Why**: Liability risk, not our positioning

### ❌ Meeting Notes Features
- No meeting transcription for groups
- No collaboration features
- No meeting templates
- **Why**: Granola owns this space, we focus on personal thinking

### ❌ Conversational AI
- No back-and-forth chatbot
- No real-time responses during recording
- No AI interrupting your flow
- **Why**: We're non-reactive by design - that's our differentiation from ChatGPT

### ❌ Complex Wellness Tracking
- No habit tracking
- No goal setting
- No virtue scores
- **Why**: Adds complexity, distracts from core value (clarity from thinking)

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

### Focus Principles
1. **Distill First**: Every feature should make Distill better or support getting to Distill faster
2. **Non-Reactive Always**: Never interrupt the user's thinking flow
3. **Verbal Processing Core**: If it doesn't serve people who think by talking, cut it
4. **Simplicity Over Features**: 10 people who love Distill > 100 people with feature bloat

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Weekly active Distill usage
- **Secondary**: Time from recording → Distill result (latency)
- **Tertiary**: User retention at 1 week, 1 month
- **North Star**: "Verbal processors can't imagine thinking without it"

### Anti-Metrics (What We Don't Optimize For)
- ❌ Total features shipped
- ❌ Time spent in app (we want quick clarity, not engagement loops)
- ❌ Daily active users (weekly is fine for thinking tool)

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Progressive Complexity
Start with simple features that provide immediate value, then layer on sophisticated capabilities as users develop their practice.

### 2. Philosophical Integrity
Every feature must serve authentic mental training, not just engagement metrics or viral sharing.

### 3. User Sovereignty
Users maintain complete control over their data, insights, and practice. The app serves the user's growth, not the company's data collection.

### 4. Scientific Validation
New features are tested for actual effectiveness in mental training, not just user satisfaction or retention.

### 5. Sustainable Practice
Features support long-term mental development rather than quick fixes or emotional manipulation.
